Welcome to Tea Market Online

Your source for tea, teaware, and tea accessories!

I opened Tea Market in the Fall of 2002 because Kansas City needed tea. My goal in those first few years was to create a space for people to purchase really good tea and everything needed to steep and enjoy it properly. Over the last thirteen years the shop has grown and evolved into a wellness hub with a strong tea community.

The shop is filled to the brim with an extensive tea collection, new merchandise and great gift ideas to please even the most finicky tea lover. We also offer monthly classes to help you get the most out of your tea experience. Hurry in for the best selection of tea! Or contact us about the newest classes!

For more information call us at 816-822-9832. If after hours, leave a message on our answering machine. Thank you for your business!
